# ORM-Commerce

## Description
    
- To learn how to build the back end of an e-commerce site. e-commerce platforms have a large prevalence, and full stack web developers should be able to create and manage them accordingly.
- I built this project in order to build my skill using express js to create a Server that interacts with a MySql database.
- This back end allows you to manage your database more effeciently
- This is the first time I've used insomnia in a project and so getting the routes/file structure down was a challenge. Also, the order of operations of the terminal is still hard for me to memorize.

You'll run an npm i to install. Then log into mysql and create the databse using SOURCE db/schema sql ; - then exit. After you'll seed the database using node seeds / index js . Lastly initiate the port using npm start . Then you will open insomnia and test the servers capabilities.

## Usage

- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
